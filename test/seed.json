      "highConcept": "Dishonored assassin searching for a gateway to his past.",
      "flaw": "I'm obsessed with an idea and I'll do whatever it takes to see it become a reality, even if it means the well-being of others. ",
      "ancestry": "Void Elf",
      "homeland": "Scasal",
      "age": "46",
      "faith": "Emulism",
      "description": "Taller than average. Extremely lean and not very muscular, but some musculature is visible. Silver-gray hair and eyes, dark violet skin. Sleek facial structure and strong features. ",
      "personalityTrait1": "Quiet, but defensive. Vocal about expressing doubts and cautions, little else.",
      "personalityTrait2": "Apologetic, quick to make amends, but only when I believe I have truly wronged a person. To those I kill, I sometimes send anonymous letters apologizing to the families. I never forgive myself. ",
      "ideal": "Everyone deserves a second-chance. ",
      "alignment": "Chaotic Neutral ",
      "goal": "Making amends is impossible. I must find some way back into my past to undo what I have done. ",
      "fear": "That I'll never find acceptance for what I've done. ",
      "friend": "Given my unique circumstances, friends aren't exactly commonplace in my life. Mrithun is my trusted contact with the Silence, a international group of anonymous pushers and movers. I care not what their motives are and I serve them only as a means to gather coin. Killing is one of the only things I am intimate with, so it is a perfect fit. I met Mrithun in an inn not long after I made the voyage from my homeland in Scasal. He approached me, noticing that I appeared foreign. He took advantage of my need for coin in a new and unforgiving place, but over time, I learned that he is a reliable source of information. After proving myself worthy, Mrithun rewarded me handsomely. Presently, Mrithun and I speak only when I am low on coin. Although our friendship is based almost purely on business and happenstance, I do still think of Mrithun as my friend. ",
      "enemy": "Myself. I can't forgive myself for what I've done and I can't forget it neither. There are times in combat where I am haunted by visions of my sin. In those moments I fight just as much with myself as I do with my opponents. ",
      "otherCharacter": "Vairen, a female human from Grunhijar, still writes to me even to this day. When I first arrived, I had traveled to her village and found her in the tundra nearby. She had been attacked by wolves and nearly died. She invited me into her home and provided for me for a few months before I had gathered enough coin to voyage. Whenever I move to a new area, I am always sure to write her so that she knows where to send her messages. ",
      "organization": "I am a lowly killer for hire for the Silence, an international network of anonymous pushers and movers. In the beginning the targets were always heavily armed, dangerous men. Once they realized that I was willing to get my hands dirty, the targets became softer, but the coin heftier. I made my choice. ",
      "goodMemory": "I remember the first day my father took me and my brother out to spar when we were only ten years of age. My brother had always been a more apt fighter. ",
      "badMemory": "The night I killed my brother plays in my head as the last thing I see when I struggle to dream every dusk. Every dawn the sight of his face is the first agonizing reminder of my sin. ",
      "profession": "Mercenary/assassin under secretive hire. ",
      "hobbies": "I like to sketch out landscapes and wildlife, but parchment is expensive. ",
      "socialStyle": "I am deceptive and tactful. I try to use what others have said against them to give myself leverage in a debate. However, in a casual environment, I am naturally quiet and reserved. In large groups, I feel awkward, I don't like being the center of attention. As a result, it is mentally exhausting for me to keep up a social charade. I find common-talk to be useless and boring. I speak only with purpose. I understand the necessity of subtlety in order to accomplish certain goals and so I accept diplomacy as a useful tool, nothing more. I treat my allies cordially and as a means to my ultimate goal. I'm not here to make friends. ",
      "combatStyle": "I fight ruthlessly and with extreme precision. Whereas your average warrior is trained in fortitude, resilience, and stamina, a mercenary such as myself is trained in misdirection, accuracy, and dexterity. I typically research my targets well in advance of killing them, which gives me an edge in preparation. When I am caught off guard, I use my years of experience and intuition to overcome the odds. When I have to defend myself, I try to use my opponent's recklessness against them. I utilize the momentum of my aggressor's force to redirect blows into an advantageous position for myself. I fight so bravely not because I am truly courageous, but because, deep down, I accept death as punishment for my sin. I disregard my own injuries and the injuries of others in combat. My only focus when fighting is the elimination of my targets. ",
      "equipment": "Travelers clothes (shirt, pants, undergarments), dark leather cuirass, dark leather leggings, dark leather boots, dark leather bracers, fine finger-less gloves, Elderwood sheath, dark leather belt, water-skin, assortment of leather pouches, knapsack, bedroll, elvish two-handed curved sword, looking glass, a set of silverware utensils, a set of throwing knives, a set of poisons, a set of blade oils, a weapon cleaning and maintenance kit, a small leather-bound notebook half filled with sketches, a pencil, an elvish dagger, a yew longbow, arrows, a set of wood-carving knives, a hatchet, a reasonable amount of coin for a highly skilled assassin.
